# Numerical_methods_project

A project for a group, for the course Numerical Methods in Physics (NFYB14002U) 2021-2022, on KU. <br>
The chosen project is Stokes flow (Incompressible flow of Newtonian fluids). <br>
μ∇<sup>2</sup> **u** = ∇p <br>
∇⋅**u** = 0, <br>
where **u** is the velocity of the fluid, ∇p is the gradient of the pressure, and μ is the dynamic viscocity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_flow#Incompressible_flow_of_Newtonian_fluids).
